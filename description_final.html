    <h1>CS307 Final Project: Alpha Version</h1>
    <h2>Toshali Goel and Audrey Ballarin</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>We built a graphics rendering of the Academic Quad for our final project!
        We built each building in its own JS file, along with a separate file for the lamps,
        and then loaded all the files into the <a href="project.html">demo</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tangled">Initial Plan</h2>
<p>We were initially planning to construct an animated scene, inspired by the following
  scene from the Disney film <i>Tangled.</i> <p> </p>

  <div class="container tangled">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
  <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/28064.jpg" width="50%">
</div>
<div class="col-sm">
  <p>
  We wanted to do a Wellesley take on the scene, taking place on Lake Waban with
  our Wellesley lamps floating around the scene instead of the paper lanterns used in
  the film. We were hoping to create both an animation (which runs in a standard fashion when the user presses space)
  or something of that sort, as well as an interactive element for users, where they might be able 
  to click on a particular lamp/lantern and send it floating in a random direction.</p>

  <p>However, after sitting with the idea for a bit, we realized it would be a bit
      difficult to implement and also that it might look odd, since we wanted to use 
      texture mapping to recreate campus elements like the Lake but then wouldn't be able 
      to animate it with natural looking movement.
  </p>
  </div>
  <br>
    <div class="row">

  <div class="col-sm">
  <h3>Change in Direction</h3>
  <p>We had built the Wellesley lamp for our HWK6 assignment, and decided we could try
      to recreate a section of the campus and do a virtual "tour" of it.
  </p>

  <p>We eventually settled on the Academic Quad because of its unique contained
      nature, and also because of the variation in gothic and modern styles of architecture - 
      which would allow us to explore our skills in object building and show off
      all the skills we learned in CS 307!

  <h2>The Iconic Wellesley Lamps</h2>
  <p>The first thing we created for this project was the Wellesley lamp.</p>
  <div class="container lamp">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="lamp_arial.png" alt="top view of lamp">
    <figcaption>Here is an image of the lamp from aerial perspective.
        We used hierarchical modeling in making several different meshes to 
        create the actual lamp object, then another to create an object for the 
        pole, and finally one for the base before constructing a lampost object that
        contained all these objects.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="lamp_close.png" alt="top view of lamp">
    <figcaption>This image shows a close-up of the details of the lamp that took the 
      longest amount of time to perfect. We used several different objects to create the  
      unique shape of the Wellesley lamp, and also used bezier curves to create the pieces
      that adorn the sides of the lamp as well as the spiral pole.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 class="jewett">Jewett</h2>
  <p>Next, we created Jewett.</p>
  <div class="container jewett">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="jewett.png" alt="font view of jewett">
    <figcaption>Here is an image of our Jewett rendering from the front view.
      It is mainly built out of several box geometries, and there are several
      tube geometries to form the vents on the left building. The 'windows' are 
      made out of tube geometries surrounding transparent plane geometries.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="jewett_close.png" alt="side view of jewett showcasing stairs">
    <figcaption>The most challenging part of Jewett was definitely the lower
      area with the staircases. We used the technique we learned in creating 
      fences, looping through and creating a new stair and translating it a bit
      more each time. The inner walls of the staircases are trapezoidal in shape,
      made by heavily compressing a cylinder geometry.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 class="green">Green Hall</h2>
  <p>Next, we worked on Green Hall.</p>
  <div class="container green">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="green_aerial.png" alt="aerial side view of green hall">
    <figcaption>Here is an image of our interpretation of Green Hall from the top.
      It is mainly built out of several barn geometries piercing through a central 
      barn, with two other larger barns on each side. Galen Stone Tower is built out 
      a box geometry with a boxy cylinder geometry attached to each corner.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="green_door&tower.png" alt="side view of green hall with door and tower">
    <figcaption>One of the more challenging parts of creating the geometry was 
      texture mapping throughout. We had to carefully map specific parts of the barn
      geometry to particular material indices, similar to how we completed HWK5, in 
      order to create the brick texture and the roof texture. We used a similar technique to
      the stairs to create the windows with texture mapped plane geometries. We also texture mapped
      the pattern of the tower onto each side of the box geometry, and added tubes to 
      integrate the flat texture and the 3D rendering. The door is also texture mapped 
      and we used blending to achieve the look.

  <h2>Pendleton East & West</h2>
  <p>Next, we worked on Pendleton East and West.</p>
  <div class="container pendleton">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="PNE.PNG" alt="front view of pendleton e & w">
    <figcaption>This is a front view of Pendleton East and Pendleton West. 
      Pendleton East is made of many BarnGeometry meshes of varying sizes. 
      There are also BoxGeometry meshes for details around the border and in 
      front the main entrance, as well as PlaneGeometry meshes for the windows 
      and door. All the geometries have been texture mapped. 
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm">
    <figure>
      <img src="PNW3.PNG" alt="focus image on pendleton west">
      <figcaption>Pendleton West, which is more modern in design, is made 
        primarily of BoxGeometry meshes. The rightmost section of Pendleton West,
         which connects directly to Pendleton East, contains many box geometries 
         stacked together to form the inner "cave" where the entrance is located.
          There is even a small bench for sitting! The modern windows on the 
          newer sections of PNW were created by looping, translating, and adding
           "window bars" (BoxGeometry) positioned in front of a "glass" plane.

    <h2>Final Additions</h2>
    <p>The final thing we added was GUI controls for a more interactive experience.</p>
    <div class="container gui">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm">
    <figure>
      <img src="DaySnow.png" alt="day view with snow">
      <figcaption>We used a technique very similar to the classwork in order to create 
        a snowfall effect. We had to modify it slightly to fit the size of our scene 
        and also generate natural-looking snowfalls repeatedly.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
  
    <div class="col-sm">
      <figure>
        <img src="Night.png" alt="night view">
        <figcaption>Next we created a nighttime version, which changed the lighting and colors.
          In the night view, the background scene color is changed to be a night sky color, and 
          the ambient light is removed. The spotlight is turned up slightly so the buildings are

      <div class="col-sm">
        <figure>
          <img src="NightSnow.png" alt="night view with snow">
          <figcaption>This image combines all the new features, the night view with the snow on.
