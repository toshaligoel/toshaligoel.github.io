<h1>Course Matching</h1>

<h2>Working in the Full Stack</h2>
    
<br>
<p class="center"><em>I worked in a team to design and implement an application that would recommend CS elective courses to students based on various factors such as class year, major, etc.
    I was part of the sub-team that worked on managing the databases, designing the front-end, and implementing the functionality in the back-end. Our other sub-team primarily
    focused on designing and implementing the algorithm.

    <img src="images/304_entitymap.jpg" width="100%">
</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
<p style="margin-bottom:2%">One of the first things we worked on was an entity map of the database structure
of our application. We laid out the relationships between the various types of users
we wanted to accomodate, as well as the information we would gather from each.

    is a preliminary sketch we did of the data.

<h3>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h3><p></p>

<br>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-3">
    <p>I designed and implemented the front-end of the application, and decided to start with
        some paper prototypes to give myself a better understanding of how many pages I would
        be creating, what kinds of styling I could use to unify them, and what the inheritance
        relationships between the templates would look like. 
    </p>
    <p>The picture to the right is my rough mockup of the course roster page (top left), the 
        signup landing page (bottom left), a student dashboard (top right), and the form for students to enter their information & preferences (bottom right).
        These were the first pages I sketched out, and they underwent some change before I went into the 
        coding process - for example, the course ranking form was later combined with the preferences pages.

        <p><b>Top: </b>the final prototypes for the signup and course roster pages. I
        converted my initial designs to Figma prototypes, then created templates using HTML and
        Jinja2 as well as consistent CSS styling for all templates. As we were told this project
        could potentially be used by the college in the future, I chose a simple, clean style 
        that matched the college's branding.</p>

<h3>Building Out the Backend</h3><p></p>
<p class="center">I worked on building several features in the application, including the dynamically updated course roster, 
    the forms for professors and students to submit courses and preferences respectively, the dynamically updated
    dashboards for all users, and file upload. I'm currently working on adding search and improving the update functionality.

        can now be seen on their dashboard under "Your Matches."</p>
